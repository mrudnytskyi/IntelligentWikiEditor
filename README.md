# IntelligentWikiEditor
## What is it?
I'm trying to create tools to simplify creating and modifying articles for 
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org). I call it **wiki editor** and it is 
text editor platform, optimized for operations with Wikipedia articles source
language - [Wiki markup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup).

Also, there are plans to add some smart or *intelligent* possibilities, such
as automatic article stub generating (see [first version][wb] for details),
text summarizing, necessary images searching, text translating and others.

Nowadays, project is under active development and can **NOT** be used.

## Changes
1. First version of wiki editor, named as [Wikibot][wb] can only generate 
article stubs. It is not easy to use, command-line based, so will be replaced
by next versions soon.
2. Second version is under active development nowadays.

## Usage
Sorry, user guide is under construction ;(
