# IntelligentWikiEditor
## What is it?
I'm trying to create tools to simplify creating and modifying articles for [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org).
I call it **wiki editor** and it is text editor platform, optimized for operations with Wikipedia articles source
language - [Wiki markup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup) with some _intelligent_ possibilities.

IntelligentWikiEditor is open-source software licensed under the
[GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).

Nowadays, project is under active development and can **NOT** be used as final product. But you still can checkout
the source and build it manually. Note, that Java 8u40 or later is required.
